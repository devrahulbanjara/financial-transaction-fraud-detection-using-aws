## PROPOSED AWS ML SOLUTION

### Solution Overview
Real-time machine learning fraud detection system using AWS Services.

### Why Real-Time Processing is Critical
- **Prevention vs Detection**: Block fraudulent transactions before completion rather than recover funds afterward
- **Customer Experience**: Immediate approval for legitimate transactions
- **Financial Impact**: Preventing fraud saves significantly more than post-transaction recovery

### Data Strategy
**Dataset**: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset with transaction features including (Lets assume the bank gave the data):
- id,trans_date_trans_time,cc_num,merchant,category,amt,first,last,gender,street,city,state,zip,lat,long,city_pop,job,dob,trans_num,unix_time,merch_lat,merch_long,is_fraud

**Streaming Approach**: Process transactions by streaming the data from a python script to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for and feature engineering using AWS GlueData Brew, and Model using SageMaker.
